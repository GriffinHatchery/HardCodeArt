<p>Sound is able to convey emotions that are more then just cultural. For music it seems most reasonable that this has everything to do with the frequencies that make it up. Using the Fourier Transform it is possible to map any function, including images, into the frequencies domain. My theory that the frequencies that make up images are responsible for the emotions that are conveyed by the image.</p>

<a id="model" class="anchor" href="#model" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Model:</h3>

<p>To test my theory I created a neural network using PyBrain's implementation, which I will train to recognize the adjectives people associate with art. The images will be transformed to the frequencies domain using Numpy's Fast Fourier Transform. This will be used as the inputs to the Neural Network. The outputs will be a set of adjectives. I narrowed down the adjectives to Sad, Happy, Serious, Whimsical, Peaceful, Intense, Angry, and Simple. Only images without recognizable objects in it will be used to insure that the emotions are caused by the colors and patterns not the objects.  </p>

<a id="why-should-you-care" class="anchor" href="#why-should-you-care" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why Should You Care:</h3>

<p>If the theory is right then it could be used to better understand how we interact with art. This could give insight into how we understand the world.</p>

<a id="data-collection" class="anchor" href="#data-collection" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data Collection:</h3>

<p>I am using a moving window approach to data collection. For each image I randomly choose part of the image. Either the whole image(blue), 1/4th of the image(red), or 1/16th of the image(red) is used. The part of the image used is randomized for each training epoch. </p>

<a id="data-compression" class="anchor" href="#data-compression" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data Compression:</h3>

<p>One of the major issues is that the amount of data in an image is huge. The Fourier Transform does not change the amount of data. Though if one takes the absolute value of the Fourier Transform of an image it exhibits rotational symmetry.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/suin3g/HardCodeArt/blob/master/examples/FFT3.png?raw=true" alt="FFT of image with rotational symmetry"></p>

<p><em>FFT of image with rotational symmetry</em></p>

<p>I used this fact and only considered half the FFT. I then considered only eight windows and took the advantage value of the FFT within thous windows. Each Color is considered by itself so in all this leads to 24 inputs.</p>

<a id="using-software" class="anchor" href="#using-software" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using software:</h3>

<p>After downloading code you must add the images you would like to use to a file named "images" in the project folder. I did not include the images I used because I do not own rights to them.</p>
